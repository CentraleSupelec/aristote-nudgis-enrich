An example CSV file is provided : sample.csv

For the update parameter :


* all : For all videos of the channel(s) provided, request a new enrichment

* stuck : For all videos of the channel(s) provided that are in a stuck state (PENDING, TRANSCRIBED, FAILURE), check status on Aristote :
    - if the enrichment is successful : get subtitles and submit them to the Ubicast platform
    - if the enrichment has failed or uploading the media is taking too long : request a new enrichment

* quiz : For all videos of the channel(s) provided for which an enrichment has already been requested but have no generated quiz, request a new version on the same enrichment but with quiz
